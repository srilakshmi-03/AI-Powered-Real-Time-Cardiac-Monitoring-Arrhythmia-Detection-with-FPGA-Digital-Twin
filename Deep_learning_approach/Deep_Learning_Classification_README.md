Future Enhancements  

Model Deployment on Intel Arria 10 SoC  
ONNX Conversion for OpenVINO Deployment  
Converting the trained deep learning model into ONNX format allows greater flexibility for cross-platform deployment and hardware acceleration using OpenVINO on various Intel devices. This will enable faster and more efficient ECG analysis on edge and cloud platforms.  

Extending to Digital Twin Integration  
The Digital Twin concept will be extended for remote patient monitoring and predictive health analytics, allowing real-time updates of patient heart conditions based on continuous ECG data and MRI records.  

Benefits:  
- Early Risk Detection: AI models will analyze real-time ECG patterns to predict potential arrhythmia risks before they become critical.  
- Proactive Healthcare Intervention: Doctors can receive alerts for abnormal cardiac conditions, enabling timely medical actions.  
- AI-Driven Clinical Decision-Making: Digital Twin models will assist clinicians in making informed decisions by integrating ECG, MRI, and other patient health records.
