Real-time ECG processing and detection of cardiac arrhyhtmia
This project uses the AD8232 ECG sensor and ESP32 to capture heart rate signals, process them, and classify ECG patterns as normal or abnormal using a machine learning model. The system uses VS Code, Tinkercad, and Python for ECG signal acquisition, image analysis, and classification.

üìå Features
Real-time ECG Signal Acquisition: Uses AD8232 & Arduino.
Image-based ECG Classification: Machine learning model predicts normal/abnormal.
GUI for Image Upload & Classification: Built with Tkinter.
Training & Prediction: Uses TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.
üöÄ Setup & Execution Guide
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:

ESP32 Microcontroller
AD8232 ECG Sensor Module
ECG Electrodes & Connecting Wires
Arduino IDE, Python 3.x, VS Code
Tkinter(for Simulation & Image Uploads)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Arduino Code
Open sketch_feb28a.ino in Arduino IDE.
Connect Arduino and upload the code.
Open the Serial Monitor to view real-time ECG data.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Deep Learning Model 
python train_model.py
Trains an ECG classification model and saves it as ecg_model.h5.
4Ô∏è‚É£  Run ECG Classification GUI
python predict_image.py
Upload an ECG image and get classification results (Normal / Abnormal).
üìä Example Output
Input ECG Signal (Image Upload)
Classification Result
Prediction: NORMAL (when done using a normal patient heart ecg signals. )
